# APIdia
This repository hosts public data related to the website [apidia.net](https://apidia.net), which is a collection of API documentation of open source projects. Initially, the focus is on Java API.

Please use the issue tracker of this repository to file APIdia-related issues of any kind. That can be functional website bugs, layout/css issues, typos, broken internal or external links, even content-related issues. Depending on each individual case, we may, however, forward content issues to the original authors.
For every issue, please provide a link to the relevant html page or section. For broken links, please provide a corrected link if possible.

As of this writing, this repository is empty. Eventually, it will host some publicly relevant config data for APIdia, such that users can contribute adjustments via pull requests.
