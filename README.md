This repository is the Github presence of the website [apidia.net](https://apidia.net), which is a collection of API documentation of open source projects. Initially, the focus is on Java API.

Please use the issue tracker of this repository to file APIdia-related issues of any kind. That can be feature requests, content requests, functional website bugs, layout/css issues, typos, broken internal or external links, even issues about erroneous content. Depending on each individual case, we may, however, forward content issues to the original authors.
For every issue, please provide a link to the relevant html page or section. For broken links, please provide a corrected link if possible.

As of this writing, this repository is empty. Eventually, it will host some publicly relevant documentation and config data for APIdia, such that users can contribute adjustments via pull requests.
